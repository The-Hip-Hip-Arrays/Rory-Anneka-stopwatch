# Rory-Anneka-stopwatch

The idea is to follow the TDD cycle to create a stop watch, using ping pong. Follow TDD cycle: Make a failing test, partner makes it pass. Then the partner writes a test and you swap over!

The stopwatch should have the following functionality:
* Time displayed in the hh/mm/ss format
* A start button which sets off the stopwatch ticking every second
* A stop button which stops the stopwatch ticking
* A reset button with sets to the time back to 00:00:00

Possible stretch goals:
* countdown timer,
* split timmer,
* any other functionality
